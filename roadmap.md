# Roadmap :rocket:
The following is not definitive, nor is there a timeframe specified when these changes will be implemented.

### `V 0.2.0`
- Check if `fzf` is installed

### `V 0.3.0`
- Using `fzf` internally, thus no need to have it installed

## Suggestions :thought_balloon:
Please create an issue if you have a suggestion.
